# hello-collection
Just a collection of the classic "Hello world" (hehehe) program source code files in different programming languages. So far, these languages are available:

* C
* Go
* Lua (using Luajit)
* POSIX shell
* Python

## Output of the program
As all of these files are the source code of the same program, which is "Hello world", it is expected that all of these will output "Hello, world!" to stdout.

## Contributions
Any contributions to improve this project will be welcomed.
