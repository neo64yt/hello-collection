# hello-collection
Just a collection of the classic "Hello world" (hehehe) program in different programming languages. So far, these languages are currently available here:

* C
* C++
* Go
* Lua (using Luajit for shebang)
* Perl
* POSIX shell
* Python
* Rust

## Categories
There are two types of programming language here:

* Interpreted 
* Compiled 

## Output of the program
It is expected each of them prints out "Hello, world!" (or something else), despite being different programming languages.

## Contributions
Any contributions to improve this project will be welcomed.
