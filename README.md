# hello-collection
Just a collection of the classic "Hello world" (hehehe) program in different programming languages. So far, these languages are currently available in this repository:

* C
* Go
* Lua (using Luajit)
* POSIX shell
* Python

## Output of the program
It is expected each of them prints out "Hello, world!" (or something else), despite being different programming languages.

## Contributions
Any contributions to improve this project will be welcomed.
